Charlie Kirk. Why did his murder churn me up so much? I didn't know him, and -- before he was killed -- I had only watched a handful of his videos. But what I saw was a man with conviction, unashamed of his faith, willing to engage in friendly debate with anyone who wanted to talk.

You [don't need to be a Christian](https://world.hey.com/dhh/words-are-not-violence-c751f14f) to admire that. You don't need to agree with his politics to give credit where credit is due.

People with conviction like Charlie have inspired me to be a better father to my kids, a better husband to my wife, and a better servant of King Jesus.

And Charlie's death inspires me -- and many others -- to stop being so quaint and quiet. Christmas and Easter are awesome! The Author of the universe entered His own story, and gave His life to save the world.

As Charlie [said on Twitter](https://x.com/charliekirk11/status/1964469113352573401), just a few days ago: "Jesus defeated death so you can live."

That's the entire Christian message: die to yourself, live for Christ. And be willing to die for what you believe.
