<h2>So &hellip; you want a great body?</h2>

<p>Some would say this desire is wrong, others that there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with it, but I tend to take the middle road (perhaps a sign of weakness) and say that it&rsquo;s fine in moderation. Either way, this article will steer happily clear of that particular issue, and instead address what to do if you <i>do</i> decide to shape up for the summer. </p>

<p>And summer is only just around the corner. I, for one, would certainly like to be bigger than Ben Hur when I crack out the singlet and stubbies for the next half-year. So, with hundreds of others, I will very soon be making a pre-emptive strike on my winter misshapenness, renewing my gym membership and attempting to improve my physique before summer actually arrives. And I&rsquo;ll be doing this all at the local gymnasium. </p>

<p>There is a problem, though. Visiting the gym is easy. Visiting the gym with <i>style</i>, however, is a whole different ball game. Here are some tips to ensure the attempt to sculpt your body for the warm season doesn&rsquo;t become a fashion disaster.</p>

<p>There are some things you definitely should do at the gym. The first is to bring a towel to wipe up your sweat. Benches, rowers, treadmills and cross-trainers all accumulate a lot of moisture during a workout, and it&rsquo;s up to you to clean up the mess. Wiping is a courtesy.</p>

<p>Ladies, to maintain decorum, wear a sports bra. Jordan Wilson, gym-goer of almost six years, described to me the consequences of not: &ldquo;I once saw a woman riding an exercise bike so vigourously that her breasts flapped. It wouldn&rsquo;t have been so bad if it wasn&rsquo;t accompanied by constant grunting.&rdquo; </p>

<p>Wear deodorant. I know of people leaving a gym because of an individual&rsquo;s body odour. It&rsquo;s not fashionable to be that person.</p>

<p>There are also a number of don&rsquo;ts for the budding Dan Carter or Mandy Smith. Like don&rsquo;t wear lycra. I once heard of a woman wearing a blue lycra bodysuit, coupled with tan stockings, to a Victoria University Fitness Centre pump class. Unlike mullets, lycra has not made a comeback since the &rsquo;80s.</p>

<p>Another clothing item to avoid is the ripped singlet. In fact, try not to wear anything ripped. Unless you&rsquo;re going for the Chuck Norris look, checkered shirts with the sleeves torn off are a particularly unwise choice. Whether you like it or not, the term <i>poser</i> will immediately be thrown your way. </p>

<p>Speaking of posers, don&rsquo;t make loud noises while you pump that iron. Grunting does not make the weights any lighter. An example is a character at my gym &ndash; he&rsquo;s nicknamed Gr&uuml;nter due to the exceptionally loud groans that escape his lips at every bicep curl or bench press. </p>

<p> Gr&uuml;nter breaks the final rule too &ndash; don&rsquo;t boast about your body during your workout. I&rsquo;ll never forget the day I overheard, &ldquo;Mate, when you have an arm girth of eight inches you can start telling me how to lift weights!&rdquo; Gr&uuml;nter then went on to explain to the gym that he was once nicknamed &ldquo;Chopsticks&rdquo; because of his &ldquo;massive&rdquo; upper arms. </p>

<p>Have fun in the gym this year, but remember, you now only have yourself to blame if you make a fashion faux pas.</p>
