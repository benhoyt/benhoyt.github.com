<p>W<span class="smallcaps">orld</span> is a New Zealand fashion label that really lives up to its name. Prism editor <b>Ben Hoyt</b> chats about business and fashion with their chief designer, Francis Hooper. (Or download an audio recording of the <a href="world.mp3">full interview (MP3, 6.7MB)</a>. Please note that this recording is unedited.)</p>

<p style="font-style: italic;">How did you come up with the name?</p>

<p>We wanted something that wouldn&rsquo;t box us in&nbsp;&hellip; something timeless. We didn&rsquo;t want a name that would just conjure up pretty-girl dresses or whatever. With <span class="smallcaps">world</span> we can pretty much do whatever we want underneath that name, from sublime to verging on ridiculous. But of course the other side is the fantasy. We wanted to be world-wide.</p>

<p style="font-style: italic;">Do you also try to incorporate a sense of Kiwi in your design or business processes?</p>

<p>Well, in the sense that it&rsquo;s from here, but we don&rsquo;t wear the badge on our lapel. It just becomes too parochial or political, and you kill the spark of creativity. We don&rsquo;t go &ldquo;Kiwi&rdquo; or &ldquo;Aotearoa&rdquo; &ndash; that can take away from what&rsquo;s great about the product. But we proudly say &ldquo;Made in New Zealand&rdquo; on our labels, and I believe it&rsquo;s obvious where we&rsquo;re from because of the way we approach things.</p>

<p style="font-style: italic;">What inspired you to take up fashion design?</p>

<p>I fell into it, really. I&rsquo;m not trained and have never taken a fashion course &hellip; I used to be a DJ. It was amazing, I just needed a job, and ended up at Commes des Garons, and then with John Galliano, who&rsquo;s now of course world famous. I was lucky.</p>

<p style="font-style: italic;">News articles make it sound like it was really easy for you and your wife Denise to start <span class="smallcaps">world</span> back in 1989. What&rsquo;s one key piece of advice you have for starting a business?</p>

<p>Really easy! [laughs] They sensationalise. They talk about us as one of the &ldquo;big brands&rdquo;. Of course we were a big brand, but only because we were one of the first. My advice is to work really hard, that&rsquo;s the only key thing. If you think 40 to 50 hours, that&rsquo;s a [fashionably colourful language] Victorian unionist ideal &hellip; try 70 to 100 hours. Oh, the second thing is, just have a real belief in your talent.</p>

<p style="font-style: italic;">What are some of the unfashionable things involved in starting a fashion business?</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s nothing unfashionable, really, it was a clean slate. New Zealand was uneducated in fashion, and we&rsquo;re always trying to convince and educate the NZ public and the global public. We knew we had to do this if they were going to take us seriously.</p>

<p style="font-style: italic;">W<span class="smallcaps">orld</span> is usually described as being &ldquo;avant-garde&rdquo; or &ldquo;experimental&rdquo;. Are these labels you&rsquo;d use yourself?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Avant-garde&rdquo; is kind of a redundant word. Fashion&rsquo;s gotten so slick, and it&rsquo;s become a bit of a lie, really, so much of it&rsquo;s just bull[snip]. We&rsquo;re still leaders in our field of fashion, but we do so much more&nbsp;&ndash; menswear, children&rsquo;s, women&rsquo;s, accessories. To say &ldquo;avant-garde&rdquo; is too limiting.</p>

<p style="font-style: italic;">So who would your major buyers and wearers be?</p>

<p>Everyone, really. Our average customer is 30 &hellip; well, we have lots of 20-somethings, but equally we have a lot of women up to their late forties. They want colour, something different, great shape. And men from 20 to 50 come to us. But we don&rsquo;t really design clothes for a specific sector, we&rsquo;re still very &ldquo;true&rdquo; as designers. We don&rsquo;t do market research and focus groups and all that &ndash; I mean, we&rsquo;re not McDonalds. And I think true fashion should be like that.</p>

<p style="font-style: italic;">How does a particular design get from the catwalk to the buyer?</p>

<p>Why it&rsquo;s succeeded for us is that we run our own stores in New Zealand. There&rsquo;s a true honesty there&nbsp;&ndash; if we believe in something, we&rsquo;ll make it and put it in our shops and show it to you. Internationally it&rsquo;s different &ndash; the catwalk is totally different from the store. All you&rsquo;ll ever see is a very watered-down version of the brand, so they lose it. We often stand out like a sore thumb, and the bad side is that you could hate it!</p>

<p style="font-style: italic;">Has technology and the Internet affected your business?</p>

<p>At present it&rsquo;s made it harder for us, actually. We&rsquo;re still old-fashioned, we work on patterns, we work on cloth and cutting. We don&rsquo;t sell on the net &hellip; you need to see the cut, the colour, the feel.</p>

<p style="font-style: italic;">Getting philosophical, what do you think is the purpose of fashion design? What about the purpose or meaning of clothing?</p>

<p>Fashion is to seduce, to excite, to create beauty and sexiness in both men and women. You can&rsquo;t walk around naked, you just can&rsquo;t do that. Fashion is the sexy end of clothing, and a reflection of society. Most people don&rsquo;t realise how important it is to global culture. Society at present places huge value on fashion&nbsp;&ndash; rightly or wrongly.</p>

<p style="font-style: italic;">My wife and I are expecting a baby, and have to start looking at kids&rsquo; clothing. What are some of the special things you have to think about with <span class="smallcaps">world</span> Baby?</p>

<p>First of all, we&rsquo;re running a business, so it&rsquo;s got to be practical, washable, wearable &hellip; we only use natural fibres. Basic practicality actually comes to the forefront. A baby has to be fireproof and warm. We play to the adult, but we make sure baby is protected. But we don&rsquo;t go too crazy. My concern is that mum and dad don&rsquo;t go out and spend $900 on baby.</p>

<p style="font-style: italic;">How do you balance work and social life, or work and family &ndash; or are they too intertwined to talk about balancing?</p>

<p>They have been, yes. If you go back and do the timeline, we got married and opened the business all in the same month, and then had a daughter in the same year. I have been accused of not being able to switch off, though my wife is a lot more departmentalised.</p>

<p style="font-style: italic;">How do you and Denise complement each other in your design efforts?</p>

<p>Denise is the serious one and I&rsquo;m the silly one, we&rsquo;re really chalk and cheese. We&rsquo;ve succeeded because we respect each other&rsquo;s opinions. Trust is the most important thing, and this involves money, time, direction. And also, we&rsquo;re married, not just partners in business, and that means forever &hellip; at least we hope it does!
