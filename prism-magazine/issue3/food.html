<h2>Active hospitality</h2>
<div class="author">by Maricha Dekker</div>

<p><span class="firstwords">Many of you will</span> already be thinking that hospitality &ldquo;is not my cup of tea&rdquo;, or &ldquo;we can&rsquo;t afford to feed others on our tight budget&rdquo;, or &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t cook well enough to entertain guests!&rdquo;, or even &ldquo;it&rsquo;s too much work!&rdquo; This is not going to be a recipe page as such, but more a few ideas and tips to get you motivated to <i>activel</i><i>y</i><i> </i>practice hospitality (instead of just thinking about it!).</p>

<h3 id='notmycup'>It&rsquo;s just not my cup of tea</h3>

<p>Among other things, practicing hospitality is a very good way to be a witness &ndash; not just to friends we are comfortable with, but to our neighbours, workmates, or visitors at church. In fact, the Scriptures <i>command</i> us to be hospitable: &ldquo;Offer hospitality to one another without grumbling. Each one should use whatever gift he has received to serve others, faithfully administering God&rsquo;s grace in its various forms.&rdquo; (1 Pet 4:9&ndash;10)</p>

<img class="right" src="images/food.jpg" width="250" height="152" alt="Family enjoying hospitality" title="Enjoying food">

<p>Hospitality was one of the hallmarks of early Christian communities, but today we consider it a chore rather than a virtue. Again Scripture says, &ldquo;But when you give a banquet, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind, and you will be blessed.&rdquo; (Luke 14:13&ndash;14a)</p>

<p>As you will see, hospitality doesn&rsquo;t take too much effort, and you may actually end up enjoying it!</p>

<h3 id='cantafford'>We can&rsquo;t afford it</h3>

<p>There are many ways you can stretch basic ingredients and make things from scratch very economically. You&rsquo;ll be able to feed a crowd &ndash; and for not much more than when you use prepared foods to cook a meal for only your family. Here are some ideas:</p>

<ul class="big">
<li>Buy in bulk, going halves with a friend if you find items are too large. If you have access to a Moore Wilson&rsquo;s or Rattrays you can buy some things for substantially less than in the supermarket.</li>
<li>Make the most of specials. Buy in season. Buy raw ingredients (for example, dried beans and tins of tomatoes instead of more expensive ready-made sauces).</li>
<li>Trade with others who have gardens or fruit trees. You can trade veggies, baking or whatever you have surplus of. Just ask friends &ndash; you&rsquo;ll be surprised what you can gather by trading (or even making up big batches with a friend)!</li>
<li>Extend stews, soups and even pizza simply by adding more vegetables. A really good standby to have in the freezer is cooked dried beans (such as kidney beans). These are nutritious and inexpensive, and you can cook up a big pot and divide it into smaller portions to freeze, then pull them out at short notice.</li>
<li>Use cooked chicken. This is one thing I really do use a lot when I&rsquo;m expecting a large crowd and have the day beforehand to prepare. Simply boil one or two skinned chickens in a large pot of water with some chopped carrot, onion, and celery; optionally add a bay leaf, some peppercorns, and some fresh herbs. When it is cooked (about 80 mins) strain the stock and freeze for later use in soups, shred the chicken and refrigerate. If you use a little imagination, there are many ways you can stretch one cooked chicken to feed two families: pizza (see recipe), a big hearty pot of soup, lasagne, a meat pie, on rice with lots of vegetables (and a side salad), or add a basic white sauce and herbs, and use it as a delicious filling for toasties.</li>
</ul>

<p>I use two very beneficial books by Sophie Gray (you could purchase them or borrow them from the library): <i>Destitute Gourmet</i> and <i>More Stunning Food From Small Change</i>. They are well worth the expense.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re prepared to put a little more effort into your preparation, you will soon see that you can entertain on very little!</p>

<h3 id='toomuchwork'>It&rsquo;s too much work</h3>

<p>One of the ways you can entertain at short notice is by being well prepared <i>in advance</i>. For one, it doesn&rsquo;t take much effort to have a few basics in the freezer.</p>

<p>Two work-saving appliances that I use on many occasions are a slow cooker (that is, a &ldquo;crock-pot&rdquo;) and a bread maker. A large crock-pot is well worth the investment; it&rsquo;s really easy to throw all the ingredients into the pot and leave it for the day. Our seven litre crock-pot easily feeds 20 people when it&rsquo;s full (I always try to fill it up and freeze the leftovers). A bread maker can give you really cheap bread and doughs, especially if you buy yeast and flour in bulk.</p>

<p>There are work-saving recipes, too. Chinese Corn Soup (recipe shown) is one you can make in a mere twenty minutes. It&rsquo;s great for unexpected guests.</p>

<h3 id='cantcook'>I can&rsquo;t cook</h3>

<p>People don&rsquo;t come to visit you just for the food (well, if they&rsquo;re really your friends they won&rsquo;t!). They come for the fellowship first and foremost. Most people will be more than happy to enjoy simple fare with you: soup and buns, pizza, or even a simple macaroni dish. Besides, the &ldquo;simple&rdquo; meals are generally favourites! Whatever you&rsquo;re comfortable cooking for your own family will be more than acceptable to your visitors. If you cook what you&rsquo;re  familiar with, you&rsquo;ll not only be comfortable, you&rsquo;ll be confident.</p>

<h3 id='nothingtolose'>You have nothing to lose</h3>

<p>In conclusion, I&rsquo;d like to encourage you to just open your home and go for it. You&rsquo;ve got nothing to lose, only friendships to strengthen and gain. So, who are you having over this weekend? </p>

<hr>

<h3 id='chinesesoup'>Chinese corn soup (serves 10–15)</h3>

<ul>
<li>four 425 g tins creamed corn</li>
<li>2.5 L frozen chicken stock (or 2.5L water &amp; 2 tsp stock powder)</li>
<li>salt, pepper and herbs to taste</li>
<li>vegetables and meat</li>
<li>spring onion, finely chopped</li>
<li>2 eggs, beaten (optional)</li>
</ul>

<p>Bring to boil corn, water, stock and herbs in large pot.</p>

<p>Add any of the following to make up to about five litres: chopped vegetables, chopped and cooked chicken, bacon, ham, or a couple of chopped frankfurters. To make a more hearty soup, add pasta, rice, or grated potato or kumara.</p>

<p>Simmer for about fifteen minutes, stirring often.</p>

<p>Just before serving add spring onion and whisk eggs into soup in thin stream, stirring constantly.</p>

<h3 id='pizzadough'>Pizza dough (makes 2 oven tray size)</h3>

<ul>
<li>500 mL warm water</li>
<li>2 tsp salt</li>
<li>1 tsp sugar</li>
<li>4 tbsp oil</li>
<li>4 tbsp cornmeal</li>
<li>1 tsp onion powder</li>
<li>1/2 tsp garlic powder</li>
<li>6 cups flour</li>
<li>3 tsp yeast granules (or 2 tbsp Surebake)</li>
</ul>

<p>Put ingredients into break maker in given order.</p>

<p>Set on dough cycle (may need &ldquo;helping stir&rdquo; after 5 mins). When complete, transfer to large bowl, cover loosely with oiled gladwrap and leave to rise till doubled in size (about 1.5 hours). Transfer to two baking trays and roll out to fit trays. Leave to rise for further ten minutes while preparing toppings.</p>

<p>Pre-cook the two bases for 8 minutes at 200&deg;C. While hot, spread pizza sauce on evenly and assemble toppings. Bake for around 20 minutes at 190&deg;C. Tastes just like Pizza Hut!</p>

<h3 id='pizzasauce'>Easy pizza sauce</h3>

<ul>
<li>two 425 g tins chopped tomatoes (Budget is fine)</li>
<li>1/4 cup tomato paste (optional)</li>
<li>1/4 cup brown sugar</li>
<li>2 tsp basil</li>
<li>2 tsp oregano</li>
<li>1/2 tsp crushed garlic (optional)</li>
</ul>

<p>Mix all ingredients and boil for about fifteen minutes, stirring occasionally. (If sauce is too thin, add 2 tsp corn flour dissolved in water.)</p>

<h3 id='pizzatoppings'>Pizza toppings</h3>

<ul>
<li>cheese, ham, bacon, tomato, pineapple, capsicum, onion, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>These traditional toppings are always popular, but if you want to jazz them up a bit, it&rsquo;s not hard to create a few different sensations. Our favourite at the moment is to mix a bit of apricot or cranberry sauce with the tomato base, then top with cheese, shredded cooked chicken, onion, pineapple and few small wedges of brie cheese.</p>

<p>Or, take a simple satay sauce, spread over base and top with shredded chicken, thinly sliced onion and cheese. (You will get compliments on this one.) Alternatively&nbsp;&ndash; for similar comments&nbsp;&ndash; if you have some left-over chilli concarne, spread it on a pizza base and top with a few items like corn, capsicum, kidney beans and cheese. Experiment!</p>
