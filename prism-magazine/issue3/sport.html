<h2>Tongariro &ndash; one step closer</h2>
<div class="author">by Tim Sterne</div>

<p><span class="firstwords">There are a few locations</span> in New Zealand that make me feel very close to my Maker. Ocean Beach in Hawkes Bay (when it&rsquo;s not crowded) is one of those spots; my family&rsquo;s farm in North Canterbury is another; and the most recent addition to this list is the Tongariro Crossing.</p>

<p>The beauty of this one-day hike lies in its variety. For starters, there&rsquo;s the variety of terrain. Going in the conventional direction you cross flat tussock land, traverse an almost vertical rocky slope, walk past a volcano crater (where the earth is warm to the touch), slide down a track of black ash, and descend through tundra followed by bush.</p>

<p>Then there&rsquo;s the variety in the weather. One minute you can be drenched in sweat and pouring on the sunscreen, the next you&rsquo;re frantically digging in your pack for the swanndri. Thankfully, both extremes have their advantages. Sunny weather reveals stunning vistas &ndash; you can&rsquo;t help but take perfect photographs, while wet weather creates a surreal, almost magical atmosphere.  </p>

<p>And I must mention the variety of people. There are hundreds (sometimes literally) of other people walking the Tongariro Crossing, whatever the weather &ndash; testament to its magnificence, I suppose. The first time I did the Crossing I came across the following: French (or were they Swiss?) tourists asleep in a hut, an elderly couple (still very much in love, I imagined) carefully picking their way down the ash slope, two 17 year old girls who had camped overnight in a crater, a park ranger on his way to visit the girls, plus dozens of friendly fellow hikers ready to give a wave and &ldquo;Guten tag!&rdquo;, &ldquo;Dag!&rdquo;, &ldquo;Bonjour!&rdquo; or maybe even &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; </p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re thinking of doing the Crossing, be prepared to feel overwhelmed at the bottom of the first climb; be prepared to feel exasperated at having to carry a pack full of winter clothes in 30 degree heat; be prepared to drive for hours only to be rained off and forced to return home without even getting to the start of the track.</p>

<p>But also be prepared to feel like you&rsquo;re walking on the moon as you traverse the volcano; be prepared to feel like you&rsquo;ve been dropped into a C.&nbsp;S.&nbsp;Lewis fantasy as you stare at the Emerald Lakes; be prepared to stop for a second and pretend you&rsquo;re a character from <i>Lord of the Rings</i> as you pop out above the bush line and look out over the rolling green. </p>

<p>In short, be prepared to take one step closer to God.&nbsp;</p>
