 <img class='pic right' src='imageResources/worldtshirt.jpg' width=80>Speaking of WORLD (see our <a href="/prism-magazine/issue4/work.html">interview</a> with them), here's an interesting combination: <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/stuff/0,2106,3844777a13,00.html">WORLD joins The Warehouse</a> to raise money for the Starship Foundation.<br />
<br />
Quite a contrast to <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/102/open_snapper.html">The Man Who Said No to Wal-Mart</a>.

  Thanks Ben. <br />
<br />
Seems like quite a shrewd move for World. <br />
<br />
I'm a bit conflicted about the other article. Not exactly 'small is beautiful', eh? * Snapper, the 'little guys', are a pretty big operation themselves, with 650 workers. * Odd that they are considered successful when they laid off half their employees in a decade. * There's no real critique of the Walmart way of doing things, just a pragmatic decision for this one firm. * The audience with Walmart sounds like an audience with a dictator. Belittling, undignified. * Keeping one's grass neatly trimmed is an interesting and wacky ritual.

  Well, 650 staff is pretty small compared to most "corporations".<br />
<br />
Yeah, I felt the same about laying off their staff, but wasn't sure whether he was saying that was a good thing or not. However, if those people are motivated, they'll likely as not be productive somewhere else.<br />
<br />
Does keeping one's hair trimmed fall into the same category? I guess both are something of a fashion statement. In the country, long lawn can look beautiful; in a city, somehow it looks unkempt. (Heh, article idea for next issue.)<br />

  Laying off staff isn't automatically a sign of failure, Matthew. Other factors have to be considered (factors that aren't mentioned in the article). <br />
<br />
'The Man Who Said No to Wal-Mart' didn't seem to be making much of a point. I thought it was 'quality is better than quantity' but then Weir reportedly said that Wal-Mart had done the US a great service. Perhaps it's just a nice story. Nothing wrong with that I suppose. <br />
<br />
Incidentally, I've been wondering lately whether it's more godly to produce a huge quantity of crappy, cheap products or to produce a small number of good quality, more expensive goods. Or maybe that's a *<i>false dichotomy</i>*.<br />
<br />
By the way, I like the 'If you're clever with html' thing on this comments page. Very helpful.

  Oh and Matt,<br />

Psalm 72:6a<br />

<br />
...lawn mowing is even in the Bible.
